# What is a Jr. Developer?

My Term -
 One who knows less than 10% of what they think they do. May sometimes needs help finding the compiler and/or debugger.  

The area of assumption a Jr Developer has I have labeled the danger zone. 
The area between what you think you know and what you do know.

# FIRST BUG
First Instance of Actual Computer Bug Being Found

September 9, 1947

At 3:45 p.m., Grace Murray Hopper records the first computer bug in her log book as she worked on the Harvard Mark II. The problem was traced to a moth stuck between a relay in the machine, which Hopper duly taped into the Mark II's log book with the explanation: “First actual case of bug being found.”
